LINQ for C++11 done right

introduction

The `IEnumerable<T>` interface and associated LINQ extension methods provided by the .NET framework enable .NET programmers to write concise, fluent, and composable query expressions. For anyone familiar with these tools, their incredible utility shouldn't need explaining. linq-cpp brings equivalent functionality to the C++11 environment.

If you are a programmer not familiar with .NET's `IEnumerable<T>` and LINQ, the rest of this section aims to quickly give you a basic understanding of what this library provides. (TODO)
